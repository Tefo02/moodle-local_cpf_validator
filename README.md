# CPF Validator for Moodle (`local_cpf_validator`)

This Moodle plugin adds robust and configurable server-side validation for Brazilian CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas FÃ­sicas) numbers on the user signup form. It ensures that the username field accepts only valid CPFs, improving the data accuracy and consistency of your site.

## Features

-   **Robust Server-Side Validation:** Ensures CPF check digits are mathematically correct upon form submission.
-   **Admin Settings Page:** Allows for easy configuration of the plugin's behavior via the Moodle admin interface.
-   **Flexible Format Rules:** The administrator can choose from three validation and storage modes:
    1.  **Numbers Only:** Strictly accepts and saves the CPF as `12345678909`.
    2.  **Numbers + Mask:** Strictly requires the format `123.456.789-09` and saves it that way.
    3.  **Flexible (Default):** Accepts the CPF with or without the mask, but always saves it in a clean, numbers-only format in the database.

## Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository into the `/local/` directory of your Moodle installation:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/moodle/local
    git clone https://github.com/Tefo02/moodle-local_cpf_validator.git cpf_validator
    ```
2.  Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator and go to **Site administration > Notifications** to complete the installation process.

## Configuration

After installation, you can configure the plugin:

1.  Go to **Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > CPF Validator**.
2.  In the **"Input Format"** setting, choose one of the three validation rules.
3.  Save changes.

## Requirements

-   Moodle 4.3 or higher (tested on Moodle 4.5).
-   PHP 8.0 or higher.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, the CPF validator will work automatically on the new user registration form. The "Username" field will now require a valid CPF according to the rule you have defined. Any invalid submissions will be blocked with a descriptive error message.

## Notes

-   This plugin uses the `username` field for the CPF. Ensure this aligns with your site's policies, as usernames must be unique.
-   Ensure your privacy policy covers the handling of personal identification numbers like the CPF.
